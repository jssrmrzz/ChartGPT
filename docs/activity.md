## Development Decisions

### Documentation Strategy
- **Decision**: Implement comprehensive activity logging
- **Rationale**: Ensures all development activities are tracked and can be reviewed
- **Impact**: Improved project transparency and debugging capabilities

### File Organization
- **Decision**: Separate tasks and documentation into distinct directories
- **Rationale**: Clear separation of concerns for project management vs. technical documentation
- **Impact**: Better organization and easier navigation of project files

## Technical Notes

### Project Architecture
- Medical document search system using ChromaDB and Ollama
- Two main Python scripts: `embed_and_store.py` and `query_chroma.py`
- Persistent vector storage in `./chroma_db/` directory

### Development Environment
- Python-based project
- Dependencies: pandas, chromadb, ollama
- Requires Ollama with nomic-embed-text model

## Next Steps

1. Future development should follow the workflow outlined in CLAUDE.md
2. All new activities should be logged in this file
3. Project tasks should be tracked in tasks/todo.md
4. Maintain incremental progress approach with clear communication
